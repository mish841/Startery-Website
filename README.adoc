Revamping the Startery website

Backend Features Implemented

The backend service is built to accept HTTP GET requests and provides endpoints for various functionalities:

Profile Creation API
Endpoint: http://localhost:8080/studentprofile/{id}
Response: JSON representation of the student's profile

Testing the Service
cd into the folder called complete
run it with this command: ./mvnw spring-boot:run

Once the service is running, and you've added this as GET request in POSTMAN: localhost:8080/studentprofile/2 you can now test it by visiting:
Profile API: http://localhost:8080/studentprofile/2
